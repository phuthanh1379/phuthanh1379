Hi, my name is Thanh. And welcome to my Github profile.<br>
I am a Unity developer and I love working on anything related to games, as well as drawing and writing.<br>
I also have worked on front-end development (Angular 2, React JS), backend development (FastAPI) and Machine Learning projects using Python.<br>
I am currently still learning (and probably continue to do so) about game development, and I always look out for an opportunity to gain more skills and experience on this field. In the past, I had been somewhat familiar with GameMaker Studio 2, and at the moment I am working mainly with Unity. In the future, I hope to expand my knowledge to other engines, such as Unreal Engine.
